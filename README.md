2)WAP to calculate and display binomial coefficient for the given values of n and r using function.[nCr = n!/r!(n-r)!]  
3)Write a function to return addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two numbers recieved as parameter from the calling function display the result.
4)Write a function that recieves a number as parameter and return one if it is a palindrome number otherwise return zero display the appropriate message. 
5)Write  a program to calculate and display power of base and exponent that is a raise to pwer b using user defined function. If the exponent is not passed by the user then the square of the given number should be calculated. Impliment the above program for both situations.
6)Write the output of the following :-
    def Convert(X=45,Y=30):
          X=X+Y        
          Y=X-Y          
          print(X,"&",Y)
          return X
    A=250
    B=150
    A=Convert(A,B)
    print(A,"&",B)
    B=Convert(B)
    print(A,"&",B)
    A=Convert(A)
    print(A,"&",B)
7) Write a function bsort() to sort a list of numbers in ascending order using bubble sort where the list is passed as parameter. WAP to input a list of numbers sort the list using function and display the result.
8) Write a function isort() to sort a list of numbers in ascending order using insertion sort where the list is passed as parameter. WAP to input a list of numbers sort the list using function and display the result.

                                                                     #assignment 1 functions

1. Write a function sumseries( ) having two parameters X and n which returns the sum of 
following series given below :−−−
Note : ے2 means factorial of number 2
1 _ X + X
2
 _ X

2. XYZ store plans to give festival discount to its customers. The store management has 
decided to give discount on the following criteria: 
Shopping Amount Discount Offered 
>=500 and< 1000 5%
>=1000 and < 2000 8%
>=2000 10% 
An additional discount of 5% is given to customers who are the members of the store. 
Create a program using user defined function that accepts the shopping amount as a 
parameter and calculates discount and net amount payable on the basis of the following 
conditions: Net Payable Amount = Total Shopping Amount – Discount.
3. Write a program using a user defined function that displays sum of first n natural 
numbers, where n is passed as an argument.
4. Write a program using a user defined function myMean() to calculate the mean of floating 
values stored in a list.5. Write a program using a user defined function that accepts the first name and lastname as 
arguments, concatenate them to get full name and displays the output as: Hello full name
6. Write a program that accepts numerator and denominator of a fractional number and calls 
a user defined function mixedFraction() when the fraction formed is not a proper fraction. 
The default value of denominator is 1. The function displays a mixed fraction only if the 
fraction formed by the parameters does not evaluate to a whole number.
7. Write a program using user defined function that accepts length and breadth of a rectangle 
and returns the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
8. Write a program with a user defined function to count the number of times a character 
(passed as argument) occurs in the given string.
9. Write a program with a user defined function with string as a parameter which replaces 
all vowels in the string with '*'.
10. Write a program which reverses a string passed as parameter and stores the reversed 
string in a new string. Use a user defined function for reversing the string.
11. Write a program using a user defined function to check if a string is a palindrome or not. 
(A string is called palindrome if it reads same backwards as forward. For example, Kanak 
is a palindrome.)
12. Write a program to read a list of n integers and find their median using user defined 
function which accepts list as parameter and returns median
Note: The median value of a list of values is the middle one when they are arranged in 
order. If there are two middle values then take their average.
13. Write a program to read a list of elements. Modify this list so that it does not contain any 
duplicate elements, i.e., all elements occurring multiple times in the list should appear 
only once. Use user defined function which accepts list as parameter Note : Do not use 
other list .
14. Write a user defined function that receives two string arguments and checks whether they 
are same length strings ; returns True if same in length else returns False
15. Write a user defined function that takes two numbers and returns the number that has 
minimum one’s digit. e.g. if number passed are 491 and 278 the function will return 491 
because it has got minimum one’s digit out of two given numbers(491’s 1 is < 278’s 8)
16. Write a user defined function arrangelements(X),that accepts a list X of integers and sets 
all the negative elements to the left and all positive elements to the right of the list. 
Eg: if L =[1,-2,3,4,-5,7] , the output should be: [-2,-5,1,3,4,7] 
17. Write a method in python to display the elements of list thrice if it is a number and 
display the element terminated with '#' if it is not a number.
For example, if the content of list is as follows: 
ThisList=['41','DROND','GIRIRAJ','13','ZARA'] 
414141
DROND#
GIRlRAJ# 
131313 
ZARA#
